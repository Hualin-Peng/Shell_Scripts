在linux下安装软件包的时候,有时候提示
configure: error: newly created file is older than distributed files!
Check your system clock
出现此编译错误，请检查你的系统时间是否设置有误
查看硬件日期时间
hwclock -show
linux是每隔一段时间将系统时间写入 硬件bois的 如果刚设置完了就关机,开机后时间还是等于没有设置
# date -s 991128
Sun Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 1999
实例：设置时间伟2008年8月8号12:00
# date -s “2008-08-08 12:00:00″
修改完后,记得输入:
clock -w
把系统时间写入CMOS即可
Linux 查看U盘
ls   /dev/sd*

1.解压ntfs-3g
tar -zxvf   *.gz
2.
    ./configure
    make
    make install

Installation
Linux: Most distributions include and use NTFS-3G by default. Please use that one unless it’s an old version. If you wish to install NTFS-3G from the source code then make sure you have installed the basic development tools (gcc compiler, libc-dev libraries). Then type:

./configure
make
make install # or 'sudo make install' if you aren't root

Non-Linux: Please see the OS specific installation and source packages above.

Usage
If there was no error during installation then the NTFS volume can be mounted in read-write mode for everybody as follows. Unmount the volume if it had already been mounted, replace /dev/sda1 and /mnt/windows, if needed.

mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt/windows

Please see the NTFS-3G Manual for more options and examples.

You can also make NTFS to be mounted during boot by adding the following line to the end of the /etc/fstab file:

/dev/sda1 /mnt/windows ntfs-3g defaults 0 0
